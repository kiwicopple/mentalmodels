    name: 'Inversion',
    category: 'General Thinking Concepts',
    description: `Otherwise known as thinking through a situation in reverse or thinking "backwards," inversion is a problem-solving technique. Often by considering what we want to avoid rather than what we want to get, we come up with better solutions. Inversion works not just in mathematics but in nearly every area of life. As the saying goes, "Just tell me where I'm going to die so I can never go there."`

    name: 'Falsification / Confirmation Bias',
    category: 'General Thinking Concepts',
    description: `What a man wishes, he also believes. Similarly, what we believe is what we choose to see. This is commonly referred to as the confirmation bias. It is a deeply ingrained mental habit, both energy-conserving and comfortable, to look for confirmations of long-held wisdom rather than violations. Yet the scientific process – including hypothesis generation, blind testing when needed, and objective statistical rigor – is designed to root out precisely the opposite, which is why it works so well when followed.

The modern scientific enterprise operates under the principle of falsification: A method is termed scientific if it can be stated in such a way that a certain defined result would cause it to be proved false. Pseudo-knowledge and pseudo-science operate and propagate by being unfalsifiable – as with astrology, we are unable to prove them either correct or incorrect because the conditions under which they would be shown false are never stated.`

    name: 'Circle of Competence',
    category: 'General Thinking Concepts',
    description: `An idea introduced by Warren Buffett and Charles Munger in relation to investing: each individual tends to have an area or areas in which they really, truly know their stuff, their area of special competence. Areas not inside that circle are problematic because not only are we ignorant about them, but we may also be ignorant of our own ignorance. Thus, when we're making decisions, it becomes important to define and attend to our special circle, so as to act accordingly.`

    name: `The Principle of Parsimony (Occam's Razor)`,
    category: 'General Thinking Concepts',
    description: `Named after the friar William of Ockham, Occam's Razor is a heuristic by which we select among competing explanations. Ockham stated that we should prefer the simplest explanation with the least moving parts: it is easier to falsify (see: Falsification), easier to understand, and more likely, on average, to be correct. This principle is not an iron law but a tendency and a mindset: If all else is equal, it's more likely that the simple solution suffices. Of course, we also keep in mind Einstein's famous idea (even if apocryphal) that "an idea should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler."`

  {
    name: `Hanlon's Razor`,
    category: 'General Thinking Concepts',
    description: `Harder to trace in its origin, Hanlon's Razor states that we should not attribute to malice that which is more easily explained by stupidity. In a complex world, this principle helps us avoid extreme paranoia and ideology, often very hard to escape from, by not generally assuming that bad results are the fault of a bad actor, although they can be. More likely, a mistake has been made.`

  {
    name: `Second-Order Thinking`,
    category: 'General Thinking Concepts',
    description: `In all human systems and most complex systems, the second layer of effects often dwarfs the first layer, yet often goes unconsidered. In other words, we must consider that effects have effects. Second-order thinking is best illustrated by the idea of standing on your tiptoes at a parade: Once one person does it, everyone will do it in order to see, thus negating the first tiptoer. Now, however, the whole parade audience suffers on their toes rather than standing firmly on their whole feet.`

  {
    name: `The Map Is Not the Territory`,
    category: 'General Thinking Concepts',
    description: `The map of reality is not reality itself. If any map were to represent its actual territory with perfect fidelity, it would be the size of the territory itself. Thus, no need for a map! This model tells us that there will always be an imperfect relationship between reality and the models we use to represent and understand it. This imperfection is a necessity in order to simplify. It is all we can do to accept this and act accordingly.`

  {
    name: `Thought Experiments`,
    category: 'General Thinking Concepts',
    description: `A technique popularized by Einstein, the thought experiment is a way to logically carry out a test in one's own head that would be very difficult or impossible to perform in real life. With the thought experiment as a tool, we can solve problems with intuition and logic that could not be demonstrated physically, as with Einstein imagining himself traveling on a beam of light in order to solve the problem of relativity.`

  {
    name: `Mr. Market`,
    category: 'General Thinking Concepts',
    description: `Mr. Market was introduced by the investor Benjamin Graham in his seminal book The Intelligent Investor to represent the vicissitudes of the financial markets. As Graham explains, the markets are a bit like a moody neighbor, sometimes waking up happy and sometimes waking up sad – your job as an investor is to take advantage of him in his bad moods and sell to him in his good moods. This attitude is contrasted to an efficient-market hypothesis in which Mr. Market always wakes up in the middle of the bed, never feeling overly strong in either direction.`

  {
    name: `Probabilistic Thinking (See also: Numeracy/Bayesian Updating)`,
    category: 'General Thinking Concepts',
    description: `The unknowable human world is dominated by probabilistic outcomes, as distinguished from deterministic ones. Although we cannot predict the future with great certainty, we are wise to ascribe odds to more and less probable events. We do this every day unconsciously as we cross the street and ascribe low, yet not negligible, odds of being hit by a car.`

  {
    name: `Default Status`,
    category: 'General Thinking Concepts',
    description: `The USCB ecologist/economist Garrett Hardin once said that "The scientific mind is not closed: it is merely well-guarded by a conscientious and seldom sleeping gatekeeper." The way it does that is with the concept of the default status: The "resting position" of common sense, whereby the burden of proof falls on assertions to the contrary. Given the problem of opportunity costs and limited time and energy, a default status is nearly always necessary to avoid wasting time. Examples include the laws of thermodynamics, the law of natural selection, and the incentive-caused bias.`
