    description: `In a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to their level of incompetence. People get promoted based on their current performance until they reach a position where they can no longer perform effectively. Once there, promotions stop, leaving them stuck in roles they cannot handle well. This explains why many organizations end up with incompetent people in management positions â€“ they were good at their previous job, but lack the different skills required for their current role.`,
