    name: "Opportunity Costs",
    category: "Microeconomics & Strategy",
    description: `Doing one thing means not being able to do another. We live in a world of trade-offs, and the concept of opportunity cost rules all. Most aptly summarized as "there is no such thing as a free lunch."`,

  {
    name: "Creative Destruction",
    category: "Microeconomics & Strategy",
    description: `Coined by economist Joseph Schumpeter, the term "creative destruction" describes the capitalistic process at work in a functioning free-market system. Motivated by personal incentives (including but not limited to financial profit), entrepreneurs will push to best one another in a never-ending game of creative one-upmanship, in the process destroying old ideas and replacing them with newer technology. Beware getting left behind.`,

    name: "Comparative Advantage",
    category: "Microeconomics & Strategy",
    description: `The Scottish economist David Ricardo had an unusual and non-intuitive insight: Two individuals, firms, or countries could benefit from trading with one another even if one of them was better at everything. Comparative advantage is best seen as an applied opportunity cost: If it has the opportunity to trade, an entity gives up free gains in productivity by not focusing on what it does best.`,

  {
    name: "Specialization (Pin Factory)",
    category: "Microeconomics & Strategy",
    description: `Another Scottish economist, Adam Smith, highlighted the advantages gained in a free-market system by specialization. Rather than having a group of workers each producing an entire item from start to finish, Smith explained that it's usually far more productive to have each of them specialize in one aspect of production. He also cautioned, however, that each worker might not enjoy such a life; this is a trade-off of the specialization model.`,

    name: "Seizing the Middle",
    category: "Microeconomics & Strategy",
    description: `In chess, the winning strategy is usually to seize control of the middle of the board, so as to maximize the potential moves that can be made and control the movement of the maximal number of pieces. The same strategy works profitably in business, as can be demonstrated by John D. Rockefeller's control of the refinery business in the early days of the oil trade and Microsoft's control of the operating system in the early days of the software trade.`,

    name: "Trademarks, Patents, and Copyrights",
    category: "Microeconomics & Strategy",
    description: `These three concepts, along with other related ones, protect the creative work produced by enterprising individuals, thus creating additional incentives for creativity and promoting the creative-destruction model of capitalism. Without these protections, information and creative workers have no defense against their work being freely distributed.`,

    name: "Double-Entry Bookkeeping",
    category: "Microeconomics & Strategy",
    description: `One of the marvels of modern capitalism has been the bookkeeping system introduced in Genoa in the 14th century. The double-entry system requires that every entry, such as income, also be entered into another corresponding account. Correct double-entry bookkeeping acts as a check on potential accounting errors and allows for accurate records and thus, more accurate behavior by the owner of a firm.`,

    name: "Utility (Marginal, Diminishing, Increasing)",
    category: "Microeconomics & Strategy",
    description: `The usefulness of additional units of any good tends to vary with scale. Marginal utility allows us to understand the value of one additional unit, and in most practical areas of life, that utility diminishes at some point. On the other hand, in some cases, additional units are subject to a "critical point" where the utility function jumps discretely up or down. As an example, giving water to a thirsty man has diminishing marginal utility with each additional unit, and can eventually kill him with enough units.`,

    name: "Bottlenecks",
    category: "Microeconomics & Strategy",
    description: `A bottleneck describes the place at which a flow (of a tangible or intangible) is stopped, thus holding it back from continuous movement. As with a clogged artery or a blocked drain, a bottleneck in production of any good or service can be small but have a disproportionate impact if it is in the critical path.`,

    name: "Prisoner's Dilemma",
    category: "Microeconomics & Strategy",
    description: `The Prisoner's Dilemma is a famous application of game theory in which two prisoners are both better off cooperating with each other, but if one of them cheats, the other is better off cheating. Thus the dilemma. This model shows up in economic life, in war, and in many other areas of practical human life. Though the prisoner's dilemma theoretically leads to a poor result, in the real world, cooperation is nearly always possible and must be explored.`,

    name: "Bribery",
    category: "Microeconomics & Strategy",
    description: `Often ignored in mainstream economics, the concept of bribery is central to human systems: Given the chance, it is often easier to pay a certain agent to look the other way than to follow the rules. The enforcer of the rules is then neutralized. This principle/agent problem can be seen as a form of arbitrage.`,

  {
    name: "Arbitrage",
    category: "Microeconomics & Strategy",
    description: `Given two markets selling an identical good, an arbitrage exists if the good can profitably be bought in one market and sold at a profit in the other. This model is simple on its face, but can present itself in disguised forms: The only gas station in a 50-mile radius is also an arbitrage as it can buy gasoline and sell it at the desired profit (temporarily) without interference. Nearly all arbitrage situations eventually disappear as they are discovered and exploited.`,

    name: "Supply and Demand",
    category: "Microeconomics & Strategy",
    description: `The basic equation of biological and economic life is one of limited supply of necessary goods and competition for those goods. Just as biological entities compete for limited usable energy, so too do economic entities compete for limited customer wealth and limited demand for their products. The point at which supply and demand for a given good are equal is called an equilibrium; however, in practical life, equilibrium points tend to be dynamic and changing, never static.`,

    name: "Scarcity",
    category: "Microeconomics & Strategy",
    description: `Game theory describes situations of conflict, limited resources, and competition. Given a certain situation and a limited amount of resources and time, what decisions are competitors likely to make, and which should they make? One important note is that traditional game theory may describe humans as more rational than they really are. Game theory is theory, after all.`,
